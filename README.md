- Users understand basic wishlist/shopping concepts

### Current Limitations
- **Authentication**: Uses dummy/mock authentication (not production-ready)
- **Database**: File-based storage instead of persistent database
- **Real-time**: No WebSocket implementation (would need Socket.io)
- **Image Upload**: Only supports URLs, not direct file uploads
- **Invitation System**: Mocked functionality, not fully implemented
- **Error Handling**: Basic error handling, needs enhancement for production
- **Validation**: Minimal input validation on frontend and backend
- **Security**: No advanced security measures (rate limiting, input sanitization)
- **Scalability**: Not optimized for large numbers of users or items
